2016-01-17:
Fixed a bug with Unified Inventory that could crash the game.
Worked on adding the textures for the meats.
Discovered that my groups aren't working, can't figure out why either.

2016-01-13:
Tweaked hunger and thirst speed.
Added Goat mob.
Changed around drops for animals.
Added some new foods to food mod.
A few tweaks to plants modpack so berry bushes should start appearing in game again.

2015-12-10:
Updated traps to work correctly for freeing and butchering animals.
Tweaked some grouping for the traps so more baits will bring in game.

Added the Bees mod, fixed the leaves to be in the kindling group again.

2015-10-7:
Added in a few mobs, have yet to tweak the spawn rates to make them much rarer. Also want to make them run away from the player, though I don't seem to notice an option for that.

2015-09-22:
Added the ambience mod, to create more immersive gameplay.

2015-09-10:
Major updates on traps. Currently you can only use raw meat to bait them. all buttons should be working in the formspecs.

Started work on ABMs for traps and did some minor coding changes in the nodes and formspecs

2015-09-07:
Updated Goblins Mod again.

Updated Goblins Mod again.
Snare now has several states with different formspecs for each.

2015-09-02:
Updated More_fire to fix a few missing textures.
Tweaked around grass growth and spread ABMs. Grass will now just grow on soils that have full grass texture on top, which should help with the disparity in looks.
Tweaked the ABM for the trail erosion, dirt nodes only change back into grass if they have air on top of them. This fixes the issue of default:dirt_with_grass showing up under water.
Added model and start of code for a simple snare.
Started working on food poisoning, currently there is some problem with the pathogen actually kicking in, but other coding is all set to go.

2015-08-27:
Updated More_fire and Survival
Added a couple ABMs for grass spreading and growth.

Added intersecting mod from paramat. Should be easier to find Goblins in underground caves with this.
Updated Default.

Well bottoms are now placable on any nodes that belong to the soil group, code also got a huge cleanup from that change.
Smokers are still very hacky, use at your own risk, they don't smoke anything yet, so there really is no point to use them.

2015-08-10:
Put code on github.

2015-08-01:
Added inventory image for smoker.
Created active smoker node, started working on coding.

2015-07-31:
Fixed bug in trail code, it now functions properly for grasses and soils.
Added mesh and texture for the smoker, no coding yet.
