This mod adds several Goblins to Minetest that should spawn near ore deposits or lairs underground.

v0.05 Fix errors in .04, remove texture names from goblin model, and add cobble goblins to build goblin lairs.

v0.04 Thieving goblins!

v0.03 This is a test version that adds a goblin king! Thanks to Napiophelios!  Some more texture refinement and fixed naming of textures.

v0.02 This is a test version and some the goblins will not attack unless attacked. Variety varies with ore...

v0.01 This is a test version and all the goblins act like an NPC and will not attack unless attacked.
