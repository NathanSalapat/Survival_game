This minetest mod expands the basic set of farming-related
crops that minetest_game offers. A list of crops/crafts is
below.

1. Melons

Melon plants grow from melon seeds. Once a plant is mature (there
are 5 stages) it will spawn a melon block adjacent to the plant.
The melon block can be harvested by punching, and yields 3-5
melon slices. The melon slice can be crafted to a melon seed.

2. Corn.

Corn plants are 2 blocks high, and yield corn cobs. These can be
cooked to corn-on-the-cob, or processed to make corn seed (corn
kernels, basically).

Digging a mature plant yields the corn cob. A harvested corn plant
"wilts", and needs to be dug away to make the land usable, or can
be left as ornamental 2-block plant. Digging either top or bottom
block works in all cases.

3. Tomatoes.

Tomatoes appear to work simple enough, until you harvest them
the first time: The plant stays! However, after the 3rd to 5th
harvest, the plant wilts and needs to be removed, since no more
tomatoes will grow on the plant. Per harvest you can get 1-2
tomatoes only. You can craft the tomatoes to tomato seeds, as
expected.

4. Potatoes.

The plants themselves don't drop anything. Only if the plant matures
can you dig potatoes from the soil. If you can reach the soil from the
side you can save yourself one dig by digging the soil as that will
remove the plant from the top, but otherwise you need to dig twice:
once to remove the plant, once to dig out the potatoes.

You get 3-5 potatoes. Each potato gives one (set of) "potato eyes"
which are the clones that can grow back to potatoes. Be careful not
to dig the plant when there's flowers! You have to wait until the soil
below shows potatoes. It's fairly easy to see the difference, though.

5. Green Beans

These green beans are unnaturally green, but there's so many
of them that grow on a vine! Sadly, these beans don't grow beans
unsupported, so you stick some sticks together to make a beanpole,
something like this way:

empty empty empty
stick empty stick
stick empty stick

There, that should help the viney bean plant to grow to 2 meters
high. It has remarkable purple flowers, that pop all over the plant
just before the beans grow.

Sadly, once the beans are picked, this plant turns into an unusable
mess that makes it hard for the next plant to grow on the beanpole,
so you salvage the beanpole's sticks after harvesting in order to
make more beanpoles again. It's a bit of work, but worth it, these
beans are delicious!
