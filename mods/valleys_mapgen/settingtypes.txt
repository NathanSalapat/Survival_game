#    ABOUT SETTINGS

#    Settings are presents twice :
#   -- In every world :
#      world_directory/vmg.conf

#      Format in vmg.conf:
#      flags aren't preceded by "vmg_", like this:

#      version = 2.3
#      water_level = 1

#   -- In the main directory :
#      usually main_directory/minetest.conf

#      Format in minetest.conf:
#      Unlike in vmg.conf, flags are preceded by "vmg_"

#      vmg_version = 2.3
#      vmg_water_level = 1

#    HOW TO CHANGE IT

#    You can simply change it in minetest.conf (will affect new worlds only) or in vmg.conf (will affect the involved world only)
#    But the recent builds (since October 24th 2015) provide a GUI setting system, thanks to PilzAdam, for which Valleys Mapgen has been made compatible.
